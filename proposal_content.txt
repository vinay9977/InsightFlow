Project Name and Description
Project Name: InsightFlow: A User-Friendly Platform for Psychological Surveys

Description:
Survey Metrics aims to address the challenge of conducting and analyzing psychological surveys efficiently. Traditional survey tools often lack user-friendliness for both administrators and participants, leading to reduced engagement and data accuracy. This project proposes an intuitive, secure, and robust platform that streamlines survey creation, data collection, and statistical analysis.
By implementing enhanced data security, an intuitive user experience, and advanced analytical tools, the platform empowers researchers and organizations to derive actionable insights while ensuring compliance with data protection standards. This project is valuable academically as it combines full-stack development skills with psychological research requirements, and as a product, it meets the growing demand for accessible and reliable survey tools.
Technology List
Frontend: HTML, CSS (for user interface and user experience design)
